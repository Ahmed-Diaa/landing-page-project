# landing-page-project
this project is a multi-section landing page in which contents could be added to the page dynamically with a dynamically built navigation menu.
the section which is actively viewed by the user is  differentiated by style.
when a user clicks on a navigation item, the item will scroll him to the appropriate section rather than giving the default jump.
the project is responsive to multiple screens' sizes by media query.
I have used HTML, CSS and JS.
